📘 Overview  
This project focuses on identifying and analyzing common security vulnerabilities in a sample web application, including *SQL Injection, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and **Authentication flaws*. The goal is to perform penetration testing and propose effective mitigation strategies.

🎯 Objectives  
- Detect and analyze vulnerabilities in a web application.  
- Evaluate potential security risks and their impact.  
- Suggest mitigation and secure coding practices.  

🛠 Tools Used  
- 🧰 *OWASP ZAP* – Automated vulnerability scanner  
- 🧩 *Burp Suite* – Manual and advanced penetration testing  
- ⚙ *SQLMap* – SQL injection testing and database exploitation  

📊 Results & Findings  

| Vulnerability Type | Description | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| *SQL Injection* | Malicious queries used to manipulate database input. | 🔴 High | Use parameterized queries and input validation. |
| *Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)* | Injected scripts executed in the client browser. | 🟠 Medium | Apply output encoding and input sanitization. |
| *Authentication Flaw* | Weak password and brute-force vulnerability. | 🔴 High | Implement rate limiting and password strength rules. |

📈 Project Insights
